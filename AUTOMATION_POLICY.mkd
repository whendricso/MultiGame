# Automation Policy #
**A policy guiding, i.e. limiting, the use of automation tools is vital to the purpose of MultiGame:**
- When contributing changes, please limit machine learning use to code review and debugging purposes, and **don't submit new features that have been "vibe-coded".**
- Use of documentation generators or implementation of other non-machine-learning automation systems is unrestricted and in fact encouraged.
- To ensure high-quality software, follow the `AgentInstructions.md` found in the project to adhere to best practices.
- Machine learning tools should be used judiciously and closely adhere to MultiGame internal conventions and Unity best-practices where applicable.
